We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute.

## Did you find an issue?

For any issues, be it a defect, a missing documentation part or any enhancement
request, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/openela/openela-documentation/issues).
Please provide as much detail as you can provide, including a reference to the
particular chapter or paragraph that the issue is referring to.

## Contribute documentation

This is a community project and we welcome community members to contribute
documentation to the project. Contributions are done [by opening a pull request against the project](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Any contribution requires a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (a Signed-off-By tag in the commit message) and must adhere to the [project license](./LICENSE).

When you contribute, please submit your pull request against the `main` branch. Please include a summary of your changes in the Pull request initial comment as well as a link to, when available, any GitHub issues that this pull request is addressing.

Make sure that all validation Git Hub actions that are getting automatically executed when you open the Pull Request are passing. When they are not passing your PR might not be getting any timely reviews.

Please do the Pull request per group / theme of change. You can use individual commits in the Pull Request to structure the changes in the form of smaller work items.

The project maintainers will review your pull request. A positive (approving) review is required prior inclusion of the change into the project.

If you have any questions, please reach out to the #documentation channel on the OpenELA slack.

For major contributions, please add your Copyright information into the the main project README. For more targetted contributions, a Copyright statement can be included at the top of the respective file(s).

Please note that contributions should apply generally to Enterprise Linux. If your contribution is specific to a customization for a downstream distribution, the pull request might not be considered for inclusion.
