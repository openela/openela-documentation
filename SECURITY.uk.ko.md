# Reporting security vulnerabilities

OpenELA values the independent security research community and believes that
responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.
Please raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability.
We ask that you do not use other channels or contact the project maintainers directly.
Non-vulnerability related security issues including ideas for new or improved security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.

# Security-related information

Please note that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate concepts and may not be sufficiently hardened for production use.
