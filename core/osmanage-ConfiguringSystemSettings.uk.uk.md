# Configuring System Settings

This chapter describes the files and virtual file systems that you can use to change the configuration settings for the system.

## About the /etc/sysconfig Files

The `/etc/sysconfig` directory contains files that control the system's configuration. The contents of this directory depend on the packages that you have installed on the system.

Certain files that you might find in the `/etc/sysconfig` directory include the following:

- **`atd`**

  Specifies command line arguments for the `atd` daemon.

- **`crond`**

  Passes arguments to the `crond` daemon at boot time.

- **`chronyd`**

  Passes arguments to the `chronyd` daemon used for NTP services at boot time.

- **`firewalld`**

  Passes arguments to the firewall daemon \(`firewalld`\) at boot time.

- **`named`**

  Passes arguments to the name service daemon at boot time. The `named` daemon is a Domain Name System \(DNS\) server that's part of the Berkeley Internet Name Domain \(BIND\) distribution. This server maintains a table that associates host names with IP addresses on the network.

- **`samba`**

  Passes arguments to the `smbd`, `nmbd`, and `winbindd` daemons at boot time to support file-sharing connectivity for Windows clients, NetBIOS-over-IP naming service, and connection management to domain controllers.

- **`selinux`**

  Controls the state of SELinux on the system. This file is a symbolic link to `/etc/selinux/config`.

- **`snapper`**

  Defines a list of`snapper` utility.

- **`sysstat`**

  Configures logging parameters for system activity data collector utilities such as `sar`.

For more information, see `/usr/share/doc/initscripts*/sysconfig.txt`.

## About the /proc Virtual File System

The files in the `/proc` directory hierarchy contain information about the system hardware and the processes that are running on the system. You can change the configuration of the kernel by writing to certain files that have write permission.

Files that are under the `/proc` directory are virtual files that the kernel creates on demand to present a browsable view of the underlying data structures and system information. As such, `/proc` is an example of a virtual file system. Most virtual files are listed as 0 bytes in size, but they contain large amount of information when viewed.

Virtual files such as `/proc/interrupts`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/mounts`, and `/proc/partitions` provide a view of the systemâ€™s hardware. Other files, such as `/proc/filesystems` and the files under `/proc/sys`, provide information about the system's configuration and through which you can change configurations as needed.

Files that contain information about related topics are grouped into virtual directories. A separate directory exists in the `/proc` directory for each process that's running on the system. The directory's name corresponds to the numeric process ID. For example, `/proc/1` corresponds to the `systemd` process that has a PID of 1.

To examine virtual files, you can use commands such as `cat`, `less`, and `view`, as shown in the following example:

```
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

```nocopybutton
processor         : 0
vendor_id         : GenuineIntel
cpu family        : 6
model             : 42
model name        : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M CPU @ 2.50GHz
stepping          : 7
cpu MHz           : 2393.714
cache size        : 6144 KB
physical id       : 0
siblings          : 2
core id           : 0
cpu cores         : 2
apicid            : 0
initial apicid    : 0
fpu               : yes
fpu_exception     : yes
cpuid level       : 5
wp                : yes
...
```

For files that contain nonhuman-readable content, you can use utilities such as `lspci`, `free`, `top`, and `sysctl` to access information. For example, the `lspci` command lists PCI devices on a system:

```
sudo lspci
```

For more information, see the `proc(5)` manual page.

### Modifying Kernel Parameters

Some virtual files under `/proc`, and especially under `/proc/sys`, are writable. You can adjust settings in the kernel through these files. For example, to change the hostname, you would revise the `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname` file as follows:

```
echo www.mydomain.com > /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
```

Other files take binary or Boolean values, such as the setting of IP forwarding, which is defined in `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`:

```
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

```nocopybutton
0
```

```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

```nocopybutton
1
```

You can use the `sysctl` command to view or modify values under the `/proc/sys` directory.

**Note:**

Even `root` can't bypass the file access permissions of virtual file entries under `/proc`. If you change the value of a read-only entry such as `/proc/partitions`, no kernel code exists to service the `write()` system call.

To display the current kernel settings, use the following command:

```
sysctl -a
```

```nocopybutton
kernel.sched_child_runs_first = 0
kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns = 2000000
kernel.sched_latency_ns = 10000000
kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns = 2000000
kernel.sched_shares_ratelimit = 500000
...
```

**Note:**

The delimiter character in the name of a setting is a period \(`.`\) rather than a slash \(`/`\) in a path relative to `/proc/sys`, such as `net.ipv4.ip_forward`. This setting represents `net/ipv4/ip_forward`. As another example, `kernel.msgmax` represents `kernel/msgmax`.

To display an individual setting, specify its name as the argument to `sysctl`:

```
**sysctl net.ipv4.ip\_forward**
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```

To change the value of a setting, use the following command format:

```
**sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip\_forward=1**
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

Changes that you make in this way remain in force only until the system is rebooted. To make configuration changes persist after the system is rebooted, you must add them to the `/etc/sysctl.d` directory as a configuration file. Any changes that you make to the files in this directory take effect when the system reboots or if you run the `sysctl --system` command, for example:

```
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' > /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf
grep -r ip_forward /etc/sysctl.d
```

```nocopybutton
/etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf:net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

```
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```

```nocopybutton
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```

```
sysctl --system
```

```nocopybutton
* Applying /usr/lib/sysctl.d/00-system.conf ...
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0
* Applying /usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf ...
kernel.sysrq = 16
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.promote_secondaries = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.promote_secondaries = 1
fs.protected_hardlinks = 1
fs.protected_symlinks = 1
* Applying /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf ...
* Applying /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf ...
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
* Applying /etc/sysctl.conf ...

```

```
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```

```nocopybutton
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

For more information, see the `sysctl(8)` and `sysctl.d(5)` manual pages.

### Parameters That Control System Performance

The following parameters control various aspects of system performance:

- **`fs.file-max`**

  Specifies the maximum number of open files for all processes. Increase the value of this parameter if you see messages about running out of file handles.

- **`net.core.netdev_max_backlog`**

  Specifies the size of the receiver backlog queue, which is used if an interface receives packets faster than the kernel can process them. If this queue is too small, packets are lost at the receiver, rather than on the network.

- **`net.core.rmem_max`**

  Specifies the maximum read socket buffer size. To minimize network packet loss, this buffer must be large enough to handle incoming network packets.

- **`net.core.wmem_max`**

  Specifies the maximum write socket buffer size. To minimize network packet loss, this buffer must be large enough to handle outgoing network packets.

- **`net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control`**

  Displays the TCP congestion avoidance algorithms that are available for use. Use the `modprobe` command if you need to load additional modules such as `tcp_htcp` to implement the `htcp` algorithm.

- **`net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control`**

  Specifies which TCP congestion avoidance algorithm is used.

- **`net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog`**

  Specifies the number of outstanding `SYN` requests that are allowed. Increase the value of this parameter if you see `synflood` warnings in the logs that are cuased by the server being overloaded by legitimate connection attempts.

- **`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem`**

  Specifies minimum, default, and maximum receive buffer sizes that are used for a TCP socket. The maximum value can't be larger than `net.core.rmem_max`.

- **`net.ipv4.tcp_wmem`**

  Specifies minimum, default, and maximum send buffer sizes that are used for a TCP socket. The maximum value can't be larger than `net.core.wmem_max`.

- **`vm.swappiness`**

  Specifies how likely the kernel is to write loaded pages to swap rather than drop pages from the system page cache. When set to 0, swapping only occurs to avoid an out of memory condition. When set to 100, the kernel swaps aggressively. For a desktop system, setting a lower value can improve system responsiveness by decreasing latency. The default value is 60.

  CAUTION:

  This parameter is intended for use with laptop computers to reduce power consumption by the hard disk. Do not adjust this value on server systems.

### Parameters That Control Kernel Panics

The following parameters control the circumstances under which a kernel panic can occur:

- **`kernel.hung_task_panic`**

  If set to 1, the kernel panics if any kernel or user thread sleeps in the `TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE` state \(_D state_\) for more than `kernel.hung_task_timeout_secs` seconds. A process remains in D state while waiting for I/O to complete. You can't stop or interrupt a process in this state.

  The default value is 0, which disables the panic.

  **Tip:**

  To diagnose a hung thread, you can examine `/proc/*PID*/stack`, which displays the kernel stack for both kernel and user threads.

- **`kernel.hung_task_timeout_secs`**

  Specifies how long a user or kernel thread can remain in D state before a warning message is generated or the kernel panics, if the value of `kernel.hung_task_panic` is 1. The default value is 120 seconds. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

- **`kernel.nmi_watchdog`**

  If set to 1 \(default\), enables the nonmaskable interrupt \(NMI\) watchdog thread in the kernel. To use the NMI switch or the OProfile system profiler to generate an undefined NMI, set the value of `kernel.nmi_watchdog` to 0.

- **`kernel.panic`**

  Specifies the number of seconds after a panic before a system automatically resets itself.

  If the value is 0, which is the default value, the system bcomes suspended, and you can collect detailed information about the panic for troubleshooting.

  To enable automatic reset, set a nonzero value. If you require a memory image \(`vmcore`\), leave enough time for Kdump to create this image. The suggested value is 30 seconds, although large systems require a longer time.

- **`kernel.panic_on_io_nmi`**

  If set to 0 \(default\), the system tries to continue operations if the kernel detects an I/O channel check \(IOCHK\) NMI that typically indicates a uncorrectable hardware error. If set to 1, the system panics.

- **`kernel.panic_on_oops`**

  If set to 0, the system tries to continue operations if the kernel detects an `oops` or BUG condition. If set to 1 \(default\), the system delays a few seconds to give the kernel log daemon, `klogd`, time to record the oops output before the panic occurs.

  In an OCFS2 cluster. set the value to 1 to specify that a system must panic if a kernel oops occurs. If a kernel thread required for cluster operation fails, the system must reset itself. Otherwise, another node might not detect whether a node is slow to respond or unable to respond, causing cluster operations to halt.

- **`kernel.panic_on_unrecovered_nmi`**

  If set to 0 \(default\), the system tries to continue operations if the kernel detects an NMI that usually indicates an uncorrectable parity or ECC memory error. If set to 1, the system panics.

- **`kernel.softlockup_panic`**

  If set to 0 \(default\), the system tries to continue operations if the kernel detects a _soft-lockup_ error that causes the NMI watchdog thread to fail to update its timestamp for more than twice the value of `kernel.watchdog_thresh` seconds. If set to 1, the system panics.

- **`kernel.unknown_nmi_panic`**

  If set to `1`, the system panics if the kernel detects an undefined NMI. You would usually generate an undefined NMI by manually pressing an NMI switch. As the NMI watchdog thread also uses the undefined NMI, set the value of `kernel.unknown_nmi_panic` to 0 if you set `kernel.nmi_watchdog` to 1.

- **`kernel.watchdog_thresh`**

  Specifies the interval between generating an NMI performance monitoring interrupt that the kernel uses to check for _hard-lockup_ and _soft-lockup_ errors. A hard-lockup error is assumed if a CPU is unresponsive to the interrupt for more than `kernel.watchdog_thresh` seconds. The default value is 10 seconds. A value of 0 disables the detection of lockup errors.

- **`vm.panic_on_oom`**

  If set to 0 \(default\), the kernelâ€™s OOM-killer scans through the entire task list and stops a memory-hogging process to avoid a panic. If set to 1, the kernel panics but can survive under certain conditions. If a process limits allocations to certain nodes by using memory policies or cpusets, and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status, the OOM-killer can stop one process. No panic occurs in this case because other nodesâ€™ memory might be free and the system as a whole might not yet be out of memory. If set to 2, the kernel always panics when an OOM condition occurs. Settings of 1 and 2 are for intended for use with clusters, depending on the defined failover policy.

## About the /sys Virtual File System

In addition to the `/proc` file system, the kernel exports information to the `/sys` virtual file system \(`sysfs`\). Programs such as the dynamic device manager \(`udev`\), use `/sys` to access device and device driver information.

**Note:**

`/sys` exposes kernel data structures and control points, which implies that the directory contains circular references, where a directory links to an ancestor directory. Thus, a `find` command used on `/sys` might never stop.

### Virtual Directories Under the /sys Directory

The following table describes some useful virtual directories under the `/sys` directory hierarchy.

<table><thead><tr><th>

Virtual Directory

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

`block`

</td><td>

Contains subdirectories for block devices. For example: `/sys/block/sda`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`bus`

</td><td>

Contains subdirectories for each physical bus type, such as `pci`, `pcmcia`, `scsi`, or `usb`. Under each bus type, the `devices` directory lists discovered devices, and the `drivers` directory contains directories for each device driver.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`class`

</td><td>

Contains subdirectories for every class of device that's registered with the kernel.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`dev`

</td><td>

Contains the `char/` and `block/` directories. Inside these two directories are symlinks named _major_:_minor_. These symlinks point to the `sysfs` directory for the particular device. The `/sys/dev` directory provides a quick way to look up the `sysfs` interface for a device from the result of the `stat(2)` operation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

`devices`

</td><td>

Contains the global device hierarchy of all devices on the system. The platform directory contains peripheral devices such as device controllers that are specific to a particular platform. The `system` directory contains non peripheral devices such as CPUs and APICs. The `virtual` directory contains virtual and pseudo devices. See [Managing System Devices](osmanage-ManagingSystemDevices.md#).

## Configuring System Date and Time Settings

System time is based on the POSIX time standard, where time is measured as the number of seconds that have elapsed from 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\), Thursday, January 1, 1970. A day is defined as 86400 seconds and leap seconds are subtracted automatically.

Date and time representation on a system can be set to match a specific timezone. To list the available timezones, run:

```
timedatectl list-timezones
```

To set the system timezone to match a value returned from the available timezones, you can run:

```
timedatectl set-timezone *America/Los\_Angeles*
```

Substitute _America/Los\_Angeles_ with a valid timezone entry.

This command sets a symbolic link from `/etc/localtime` to point to the appropriate zone information file in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`. The setting takes effect immediately. Some long running processes that use `/etc/localtime` to detect the current system timezone might not detect a change in system timezone until the process is restarted.

Note that timezones are largely used for display purposes or to handle user input. Changing timezone doesn't change the time for the system clock. You can change the presentation for system time in any console by setting the `TZ` environment variable. For example, to see the current time in Tokyo, you can run:

```
TZ="*Asia/Tokyo*" date
```

You can check the system's current date and time configuration by running the `timedatectl` command on its own:

```
timedatectl
```

To set system time manually, use the `timedatectl set-time` command:

```
timedatectl set-time "*2021-07-17 01:59:59*"
```

This command sets the current system time based on the time specified assuming the currently set system timezone. The command also updates the system Real Time Clock \(RTC\).

Consider configuring the system to use network time synchronization for more accurate time-keeping. Using network time synchronization is important especially when setting up high-availability or when using network-based file systems.

If you configure an NTP service, enable NTP by running the following command:

```
timedatectl set-ntp true****
```

This command enables and starts the `chronyd` service, if available.

## Configuring the Watchdog Service

Watchdog is an Enterprise Linux service that runs in the background to monitor host availability and processes and reports back to the kernel. If the Watchdog service fails to notify the kernel that the system is healthy, the kernel typically automatically reboots the system.

To install the Watchdog package, run:

```
sudo dnf install watchdog
```

To configure the Watchdog service, edit the `/etc/watchdog.conf` file. The `watchdog.conf` file includes all Watchdog configuration properties. For information on how to edit this file, see the `watchdog.conf(5)` manual page.

To enable and start the Watchdog service, run:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now watchdog
```

The Watchdog service immediately starts and runs in the background.

**Note:** The Watchdog service starts and runs immediately after a power reset.
